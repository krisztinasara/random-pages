  <p class="abstract-body">How does speech-on-speech masking in the cocktail party situation affect the cognitive processes of listeners in different languages? In this year’s talk I report on a systematic review article in which we investigated this question. We conducted a literature search by including studies (n=68) from Web of Science and other sources focusing on the cognitive processing of intelligible speech in a cocktail party situation in three highly distinct languages. Then, we applied a qualitative thematic analysis. We found that the cocktail party problem is frequently analyzed as a two-step process, consisting of stream segregation (perceptual stage) and selective attention (cognitive stage). Studies using well-controlled, simplified speech material report the effects of perceptual and cognitive factors separately, while studies using more complex stimuli capture the close interplay of perception and attention. We interpret the results in the framework of the Dynamic Attending Theory, which integrates perception and attention by proposing that attentional oscillations track events, enhancing perception at predicted time points. We propose that neural oscillations might provide the basis for dynamic attention allocation in time. Whether cross-linguistic variables have a direct impact on attentional timing is to be addressed in future studies.</p>

  <p class="abstract-body">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental health condition linked to traumatic experiences, with first responders such as firefighters being especially vulnerable. Despite updates to PTSD diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5 (2013), no structured clinical interview has yet been validated in Hungarian. This study is a preliminary phase of a larger project to validate the Hungarian version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). We assessed the mental health of 160 firefighters in Hungary’s central region, focusing on PTSD prevalence, associated risk and protective factors, and relationships with psychological distress.

Contrary to expectations, firefighters reported significantly lower PTSD symptom scores than normative populations. However, burnout was highly prevalent, affecting 60% of participants. PTSD symptoms positively correlated with stress-related variables (anxiety, depression, physical symptoms, perceived stress, and burnout) and negatively with protective factors (well-being and resilience). Regression analysis showed that an external locus of control predicted greater PTSD symptom severity. Structural equation modeling (N = 151) revealed that PTSD symptoms were influenced by both direct and indirect pathways involving burnout and psychological distress. Key upstream factors like dysfunctional attitudes and low resilience acted through stress appraisal and burnout processes, highlighting targets for prevention and intervention.</p>

  <p class="abstract-body">This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a physiotherapist-assisted wrist-movement protocol to measure corticokinematic coherence (CKC) using electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy adults. The broader goal is to evaluate CKC’s potential as a proprioceptive assessment tool in clinical settings. Thirty-two healthy young adults participated in a hand movement task, in which a physiotherapist periodically moved their hand by relying on a “visual metronome”. We measured CKC by co-recording EEG and hand acceleration data. CKC was observed at the fundamental movement frequency and its first harmonic, mainly at electrodes above the primary sensorimotor area contralateral to the moved hand. The use of a visual metronome helped to maintain the regularity of the movement, but slight between-hand differences in movement regularity were nonetheless present. The results support the feasibility of using a physiotherapist-assisted, wrist-movement-based EEG protocol to assess CKC. This method holds promise for evaluating proprioceptive function in clinical populations, offering individualized movement control and real-time adjustments. The findings lay the groundwork for future applications in stroke rehabilitation and other neurological contexts.</p>

  <p class="abstract-body">Transfer learning is an important hallmark of intelligence. This ability enables natural learning agents to leverage knowledge acquired on previous tasks when facing a new one with a familiar underlying structure. The transfer skills of humans and other animals have been shown by several previous studies, nevertheless, we still miss a profound understanding of learning strategies that lead to successful transfer learning. 

In this study, we use deep learning-based knowledge tracing on data produced by 15.000+ human subjects. Participants were asked to play a video game and were expected to learn the corresponding affordances. The game itself was designed to measure several learning and planning skills, and most importantly, participants' ability to transfer their knowledge across different visual mappings of the task. For knowledge tracing, we use a transformer model that enables us to capture the evolving knowledge states of human participants. Gaining a fine-grained description of knowledge development on 15,000+ participants’ data will allow us to better understand which learning characteristics enable participants to perform better or worse on the transfer phase. Expected results, beyond contributing to the theoretical advancement of cognitive science, could also provide grounding for intelligent tutoring systems and individualized curriculum design.

  <p class="abstract-body">Women spend about one-third of their lives in the postmenopausal stage, making it important to explore how the accompanying hormonal changes affect cognitive function, and how hormonal fluctuations over the lifespan contribute to menopausal symptoms. We compared four groups: (1) women under-going menopause (2) postmenopausal women receiving HRT, (3) postmenopausal women not receiving HRT, and (4) women in perimenopause, (5) men. Participants completed an online questionnaire, followed by an online cognitive test assessing the five major cognitive domains (memory, attention, executive function, language and perception). Data on demographics, and health status were collected from 560 individuals, with cognitive data available for 260 participants. Based on our results, women in perimenopause experienced the most severe physical and psychological symptoms, while hormone therapy reduced these symptoms. Both physical and psychological symptoms contributed to the scores on the depression scale. No group differences were found in attention and memory performance. Group 1,2,5 outperformed group 3 and 4 in several cognitive domains. Women outperformed men in working memory updating, whereas men showed better performance in specific language-related tasks. Importantly, age and educational attainment often had a greater impact on cognitive performance—particularly on memory and lexical tasks—than menopausal status itself.</p>

  <p class="abstract-body">Narrative speech production (NSP), i.e., the conceptualization, linguistic formulation, and articulation of a story, is a multifaceted process underpinned by cognitive functions and mentalization ability, often impaired in individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). This study examines differences in linguistic formulation between individuals with BPD and healthy controls (HCs) and explores associations between linguistic formulation and temporal parameters in both groups. Speech of 33 BPD and 31 HC individuals was recorded in three task types (telling their previous day, retelling a story, picture sequences). Features of linguistic formulation were extracted with part-of-speech tagging and parsing, while temporal parameters were extracted with automatic speech recognition. A series of linear mixed-effects models revealed that NSP of individuals with BPD is mainly characterized by fewer content words, more pronouns and first-person singular verbs, and lower syntactic complexity than HCs’. Spearman correlation matrix showed a negative association between the use of first-person singular verbs and the number of silent pauses, and a positive association between syntactic complexity and the number of filled pauses. Findings indicate diminished referential and structural informativity, and an increased self-focus in BPD, suggesting that subjects may struggle to utilize cognitive resources necessary for cohesive, listener-oriented NSP.

  <p class="abstract-body">Religious and spiritual (R/S) struggles, such as questioning of faith, existential and ethical concerns, and interpersonal conflicts, are associated with depressive symptoms. Neuroinflammation is critical in major depressive disorder (MDD) and is linked to stress associated with R/S problems. This study aimed to investigate whether the presence of DSM-5 R/S problems contributes to neuroinflammation. We recruited 93 MDD patients and 93 healthy controls with and without R/S problems. MRI-based restricted fraction (RF) values, an index of neuroinflammation, were measured in the hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales (HAM-D, HAM-A), while R/S problems were quantified using the Religious and Spiritual Struggles Scale (RSS-14). Results revealed elevated RF values in the amygdala and hippocampus of healthy individuals and MDD patients with R/S problems relative to those without R/S problems, with the highest values in MDD patients with R/S problems. Importantly, R/S problems and depressive symptoms were independent predictors of RF values in the amygdala and hippocampus but not in the cortex. Elevated cortical RF values were associated with MDD. These findings indicate that R/S struggles are not secondary manifestations of depression but may independently contribute to neurobiological changes.</p>

  <p class="abstract-body">Face-to-face communicative actions (e.g. speech, facial displays, gestures) by themselves are almost always ambiguous, yet, interlocutors readily resolve the challenges of coordinating meaning and building a shared understanding during everyday interactions. How is this coordination achieved? Previous research has shown that people tend to mimic one another in interactions. Specifically, they reuse each other’s phrases, syntactic structures, synchronize their movements, prosody, and pupil size. Approaches focusing on shared conceptual space often assume that interpersonal coordination indicates the extent of conceptual alignment and, thus, predicts communication success. The current study explored this concept. We asked pairs of participants to solve a few rounds of a computer-mediated communicative task involving negotiations, while gaze direction, pupil size, head motion, audio and video were collected from both participants, along with objective measures of communication outcome (task performance) and subjective evaluations about conversation quality and relationship with the partner. Our results indicate that pairs of participants (N=124) coordinate their behavior on multiple levels, however, only the coordination of gaze direction predicted objective communication outcome reliably, while coordination in the structure of conversation affected the perceived conversation quality and partner relationship. </p>
